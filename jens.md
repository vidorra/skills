## Support

Each skill file contains:
- Core competencies
- Best practices (2024)
- Code examples and patterns
- Common use cases
- Output style guidelines
- Integration notes
- **Feedback log** for continuous improvement

---

## Feedback System

Each skill includes a built-in feedback mechanism to enable continuous improvement.

### How It Works

At the end of each skill file, there's a **Skill Feedback Log** section where agents (or humans) can report:

- **Bugs**: Issues with skill instructions or incorrect guidance
- **Documentation Gaps**: Missing examples, unclear explanations
- **Enhancements**: Suggestions for improvement
- **Success Stories**: What worked well
- **Questions**: Areas needing clarification

### Feedback Template

```yaml
---
date: YYYY-MM-DD
agent: [agent identifier or "human"]
type: [bug|documentation|enhancement|success|question]
priority: [high|medium|low]
status: [open|in-progress|resolved|wontfix]
description: |
  Clear description of the issue, gap, or suggestion.
  Be specific about what didn't work or what's missing.
context: |
  What were you trying to accomplish?
  What did you expect vs what happened?
resolution: |
  [Leave empty initially, fill when resolved]
  How was this addressed?
---
```

### Why This Matters

**All in One Package**: Feedback is stored directly with the skill, not in a separate system. This keeps everything together and makes it easy to review and iterate.

**Agent-Friendly**: Different agents may interpret instructions differently. By logging their experiences, you can identify patterns and improve clarity.

**Continuous Improvement**: As you use these skills, you'll discover gaps, edge cases, and opportunities for enhancement. The feedback log captures this knowledge.

**Version History**: The git commits combined with feedback entries create a complete history of how each skill evolved.

### Using Feedback to Improve Skills

1. **Review Regularly**: Check feedback logs periodically
2. **Identify Patterns**: Multiple agents reporting similar issues indicates priority
3. **Update Skills**: Address feedback by improving documentation or examples
4. **Mark as Resolved**: Update feedback entries with resolution details
5. **Track Metrics**: Feedback statistics show overall skill health

### Current Feedback Status

Each skill has started with sample feedback entries:

- **UX Designer**: Enhancement request for Figma plugin recommendations
- **UX Researcher**: Success story about Claude persona methodology integration
- **Mendix Developer**: Enhancement request for design property examples
- **Design System Specialist**: Enhancement request for modern CSS examples
