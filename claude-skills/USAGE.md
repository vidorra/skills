## Best Practices

### Do's ✅

**Using Skills Effectively**:
- ✅ **Be specific**: "As a Mendix UX Developer, create custom design properties for card components" (specific) vs. "Help me with Mendix" (vague)
- ✅ **Combine skills**: Use multiple skills in sequence for complex tasks
- ✅ **Provide context**: Share relevant details (contract clauses, project requirements, etc.)
- ✅ **Ask follow-up questions**: If the skill asks for clarification, provide it
- ✅ **Iterate**: Refine the output by asking for adjustments

**Business Skills**:
- ✅ **Review contracts before signing**: Always use Contract Review & Legal Advisor
- ✅ **Estimate properly**: Don't skip Project Scoping & Estimation to save time
- ✅ **Add buffers**: Use 15-25% buffer in estimates
- ✅ **Document everything**: Keep written records of scope, changes, agreements
- ✅ **Set boundaries early**: Use clear IN/OUT of scope definitions

**Technical Skills**:
- ✅ **Start with research**: Use UX Researcher before designing when possible
- ✅ **Design first, develop second**: Complete Figma designs before Mendix implementation
- ✅ **Test accessibility**: Always run Automation Tester for WCAG compliance
- ✅ **Follow Mendix best practices**: Leverage the Mendix UX Developer skill's knowledge
- ✅ **Write clean JavaScript Actions**: Use proper error handling and JSDoc

### Don'ts ❌

**Using Skills**:
- ❌ **Don't use wrong skill**: Don't ask Mendix UX Developer for UX research help
- ❌ **Don't skip contract review**: "It's standard" doesn't mean it's safe
- ❌ **Don't underestimate**: Adding "just 10% extra" isn't proper buffering
- ❌ **Don't accept bad terms**: Use Contract Legal Advisor to negotiate
- ❌ **Don't work without written scope**: Verbal agreements lead to disputes

**Business Mistakes**:
- ❌ **Don't sign unlimited liability**: Always cap liability (use Legal Advisor)
- ❌ **Don't transfer IP before payment**: Negotiate this (Legal Advisor)
- ❌ **Don't accept vague scope**: Define deliverables clearly (Scoping & Estimation)
- ❌ **Don't say "yes" to every scope change**: Use change process (Business Writer)
- ❌ **Don't skip payment reminders**: Use Business Writer templates when needed

**Technical Mistakes**:
- ❌ **Don't skip wireframes**: Jumping to high-fi designs costs more time
- ❌ **Don't ignore accessibility**: Test early and often (Automation Tester)
- ❌ **Don't hardcode styles**: Use design properties and SASS variables (Mendix UX Developer)
- ❌ **Don't use jQuery in Mendix**: Use vanilla JS (Mendix JavaScript Developer)
- ❌ **Don't skip error handling**: JavaScript Actions need proper try/catch

## Troubleshooting

### "I'm not sure which skill to use"

**Solution**: Check the "When to Use Which Skill" section above or ask:
```
"Which skill should I use for [your task]?"
```

### "The skill is asking too many questions"

**Reason**: Some skills (like Project Scoping) need specific information for accuracy.

**Solution**: Provide as much detail as you can upfront, or answer the questions - it leads to better results.

### "Can I use multiple skills at once?"

**Yes!** Use them in sequence:
```
"First, as a Contract Review & Legal Advisor, review this contract.
Then, as a Dutch Business Text Writer, create a negotiation email based on the findings."
```

### "The output doesn't sound like me"

**For Business Writers**: These skills are calibrated to your style, but you can ask:
```
"Make this more direct" or "Make this more diplomatic"
```

**For Technical Skills**: Ask for adjustments:
```
"Explain this in simpler terms" or "Add more technical detail"
```

## Tips for Maximum Effectiveness

### 1. Start Conversations with Role

Always begin with "As a [Skill Name]..." so Claude knows which expertise to use.

### 2. Provide Context

Bad: "Help me with a contract"
Good: "As a Contract Review & Legal Advisor, review this 3-month Mendix development contract. I'm concerned about the liability clause and DBA risk. [paste contract]"

### 3. Ask for Specific Deliverables

Bad: "Help me estimate a project"
Good: "As a Project Scoping & Estimation Specialist, create a detailed quote for a 10-page Mendix app redesign with custom theming. Include work breakdown and pricing options."

### 4. Iterate and Refine

Don't accept first draft. Ask:
- "Make this more assertive"
- "Add more detail to the JavaScript Action error handling"
- "Explain the DBA risk more clearly"

### 5. Save Good Templates

When you get a great quote template, contract clause, or code snippet, save it for reuse.

### 6. Combine Skills for Complex Tasks

Most real work requires multiple skills. Don't hesitate to use 3-4 skills in one conversation.

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Handling a New Client Inquiry

```
User: I got an inquiry from a potential client for a Mendix project. They want a
custom CRM with 20 entities and integrations with their existing ERP.

Response: "Let's break this down:

Step 1 - Understand the project:
As a Project Scoping & Estimation Specialist, I need to ask some questions:
- How many user roles?
- Which ERP system? (API documentation available?)
- Expected number of pages?
- Timeline expectations?

Step 2 - Once we have answers, I'll create an estimate.

Step 3 - As a Dutch Business Text Writer, I'll format that into a
professional quote email.

Step 4 - Before you sign anything, we'll use Contract Review & Legal Advisor
to review their contract.

What information do you have so far?"
```

### Example 2: Client Wants "Just One Small Change"

```
User: Client wants to add "just one small feature" - export to Excel functionality.

Response: "As a Project Scoping & Estimation Specialist, let me estimate this:

Excel export functionality:
- Create export microflow: 2-3 hours
- Format data properly: 1-2 hours
- Error handling: 0.5-1 hour
- Testing: 1 hour
Total: 4.5-7 hours

At your rate (€100/hr): €450-700

This is NOT a small change - it's outside the original scope.

Now, as a Dutch Business Text Writer, here's how to respond:

'Hi [name],

Ik heb gekeken naar je verzoek voor Excel export functionaliteit.

Dit valt buiten onze oorspronkelijke scope. Ik kan dit toevoegen voor €600
(ongeveer 6 uur werk).

Zullen we dit erbij doen, of bewaren we het voor een volgende fase?

Groet,
Jens'"
```

### Example 3: Contract Has Unlimited Liability

```
User: Client sent a contract but it says I'm fully liable for any damages.

Response: "As a Contract Review & Legal Advisor:

🚨 RED FLAG: Unlimited Liability

This is unacceptable and unsafe for a freelancer. You could be personally
liable for millions if something goes wrong.

Standard practice: Liability capped at 1-2x the contract value.

Proposed clause:
'De aansprakelijkheid van Opdrachtnemer is beperkt tot het bedrag van de
in de 12 maanden voorafgaande periode onder deze Overeenkomst betaalde
vergoedingen, met een maximum van €[contract waarde].'

Now, as a Dutch Business Text Writer, here's your negotiation email:

'Hi [name],

Ik heb de contractvoorwaarden bekeken. Één punt vraagt om aanpassing:

De aansprakelijkheid is momenteel onbeperkt. Voor mij als ZZP'er is dit niet
werkbaar. Standaard in de markt is om dit te beperken tot de contractwaarde.

Kunnen we dit aanpassen? Ik heb een voorbeeldtekst klaarstaan die voor beide
partijen fair is.

Groet,
Jens'

DO NOT SIGN with unlimited liability. This is a deal-breaker."
```

## Getting the Most Value

### Use Skills Proactively

Don't wait for problems:
- Review EVERY contract (Contract Legal Advisor)
- Estimate EVERY project (Project Scoping & Estimation)
- Test accessibility EVERY project (Automation Tester)
- Set clear scope EVERY project (Project Scoping + Business Writer)

### Learn from Each Project

After completing a project, review:
- Was estimate accurate? (adjust buffers next time)
- Did scope creep happen? (tighten definitions)
- Were there contract issues? (add to red flag list)
- Did testing catch problems? (test earlier next time)

### Build Your Templates

Create a personal library:
- Contract negotiation emails that worked
- Quote templates for common project types
- Estimation spreadsheets for typical work
- Testing checklists
