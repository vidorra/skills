- Who are the end users?
- What's the scope? (MVP vs. full features)
- Any existing systems to integrate with?
- Any existing Mendix app or starting from scratch?
- What's driving the timeline? (hard deadline or flexible?)

#### About UX Expectations
- How many user types/personas?
- How many unique page types/templates?
- Research phase needed? (interviews, testing)
- Design iterations expected? (how many feedback rounds?)
- Deliverables: Wireframes, high-fi designs, prototypes, or all?
- Existing brand/design system or creating new?

#### About Mendix Scope
- How many entities in domain model?
- How many pages/screens?
- How many microflows/nanoflows?
- Complex business logic involved?
- Integrations with external systems? (how many?)

- Security complexity? (how many user roles?)
- Mobile app or web or both?

#### About Client & Process
- Decision makers? (how many people need to approve?)
- Feedback turnaround time?
- Access to stakeholders/users for research/testing?
- Technical constraints? (Mendix version, hosting, etc.)

**Project Management & Buffer**:
- Project setup & config: 4-8 hours
- Client meetings & comms: 2-4 hours per week
- Documentation: 5-10% of total time
- Deployment: 4-8 hours
- Buffer for unknowns: 15-25% of total estimate

### Step 4: Calculate Total Hours

**Formula**:
```
Base Hours = Sum of all task estimates
Communication & Meetings = (Project duration in weeks) × 2-4 hours
Documentation = Base Hours × 0.05-0.10
Buffer = (Base Hours + Communication + Documentation) × 0.15-0.25
Total Hours = Base Hours + Communication + Documentation + Buffer
```

**Complexity Multipliers**:
- **Simple project**: Use lower end of ranges, 15% buffer
- **Medium complexity**: Use middle of ranges, 20% buffer
- **Complex project**: Use upper end of ranges, 25% buffer
- **Unknown tech/client**: Add +10-15% to buffer
- **Tight deadline**: Add +15-20% (quality under pressure)

### Step 5: Price the Project

#### Pricing Models

**1. Hourly Rate**
```
Total Project Cost = Total Hours × Hourly Rate
```
- **Pros**: Flexible for scope changes, fair if scope is unclear
- **Cons**: Client bears risk of overrun, can feel like meter is running
- **When to use**: Discovery phase, maintenance, unclear scope

**2. Fixed Price**
```
Fixed Price = Total Hours × Hourly Rate × Risk Factor (1.1-1.3)
```
- **Pros**: Client knows exact cost, you can profit from efficiency
- **Cons**: You bear risk of underestimating
- **When to use**: Well-defined scope, standard work, experienced with similar projects

**3. Phased Approach**
```
Phase 1 (Discovery): Hourly or small fixed price
Phase 2 (Design): Fixed price based on Phase 1 findings
Phase 3 (Development): Fixed price based on Phase 2 designs
```
- **Pros**: Reduces risk, allows for accurate pricing after discovery
- **Cons**: Client commits to phases separately
- **When to use**: Large or complex projects with uncertainty

**4. Day Rate**
```
Total Cost = Total Days × Day Rate
Day Rate = Hourly Rate × 7-8 hours (not 8 to account for breaks/admin)
```
- **Pros**: Simple, commonly used in Netherlands
- **Cons**: Similar to hourly but less granular
- **When to use**: Contractor roles, longer engagements

**5. Value-Based Pricing**
```
Price = Value to Client × Capture Rate (10-30%)
```
- **Pros**: Can charge much more than time-based
- **Cons**: Requires understanding business value, harder to justify
- **When to use**: Projects with clear ROI, experienced freelancers

## Scope Creep Prevention

### Define Scope Clearly in Proposal

**Include**:
- Specific deliverables (numbered list)
- What's explicitly OUT of scope
- Number of revision rounds included
- Assumptions made
- Change request process
- Additional costs for scope changes

**Example Scope Section**:
```
IN SCOPE:
1. Wireframes for 12 unique page types
2. High-fidelity designs for 12 page types (desktop and mobile)
3. Interactive Figma prototype
4. Two rounds of revisions per design phase
5. Design specifications for developer handoff

OUT OF SCOPE:
- User research and testing (available as add-on)
- Responsive designs for tablet (available as add-on)
- Additional page types beyond the 12 specified
- Revisions beyond the 2 rounds included
- Mendix development implementation

ASSUMPTIONS:
- Client provides content and images
- Client provides feedback within 5 business days
- Brand guidelines and logo already exist
- One primary point of contact for feedback

CHANGES:
- Scope changes require written approval and will be quoted separately
- Additional revision rounds: €X per hour
- Additional page types: €Y per page
```

### Scope Change Process

**When Client Requests Additional Work**:

1. **Acknowledge Request**:
   "Thanks for this input. This looks like it's beyond our original scope. Let me assess what's involved."

2. **Assess Impact**:
   - Hours required
   - Dependencies affected
   - Timeline impact
   - Budget impact

3. **Present Options**:
   ```
   Hi [name],

   I've reviewed your request for [X]. This is outside our current scope, which covers [Y].

   Options:
   1. Add as scope change: [X hours], €[cost], [timeline impact]
   2. Defer to Phase 2: We can include this in a follow-up project
   3. Replace existing scope item: We could do this instead of [Z]

   How would you like to proceed?
   ```

4. **Get Written Approval**:
   - Update contract or issue change order
   - Get signature before starting work
   - Update timeline and deliverables doc

### Common Scope Creep Scenarios

**"Can you just quickly...?"**
- **Response**: "I can do that. It'll take about [X] hours. Should I add this to our scope change list or would you prefer a separate quick quote?"

**"This is just a small change"**
- **Response**: "Small changes add up. This one is [X] hours. Let's discuss whether to include it now or save it for the refinement phase."

**"While you're at it, could you also...?"**
- **Response**: "I'd be happy to include that. Let me send you a quick estimate for adding that to the scope."

**"But I thought this was included"**
- **Response**: "Let me check our scope document. According to Section X, we agreed on [Y]. This request for [Z] is a bit different. Let's discuss how to handle it."

**"Just one more revision round"**
- **Response**: "Our contract includes 2 revision rounds. This would be the 3rd. I'm happy to do it for €[X]. Sound good?"

## Red Flags & Risk Factors

### Client Red Flags (Increase Estimate)

- **Vague requirements**: +20-30% buffer
- **"We'll figure it out as we go"**: Fixed price risky, use hourly
- **Many stakeholders/decision makers**: +15-20% for extra review cycles
- **Previous developer "disappeared"**: +25% (inherited mess)
- **Tight deadline**: +15-25%
- **First-time Mendix user**: +10-15% (hand-holding)
- **"Simple" project they describe in detail for 2 hours**: Not simple, +20%

### Technical Red Flags (Increase Estimate)

- **Legacy Mendix version**: +15-25% (older API, fewer features)
- **Complex integration with unstable/undocumented API**: +50-100%
- **"Make it look exactly like [complex reference]"**: +30-50%
- **Offline-first mobile app**: +40-60%
- **Heavy custom widgets**: +30-50%
- **Performance requirements not standard**: +20-40%

## Common Estimation Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Forgetting Non-Billable Time
**Problem**: Only estimating design/dev time, forgetting meetings, emails, revisions
**Solution**: Add communication buffer (2-4 hours per week)

### Mistake 2: No Buffer
**Problem**: Estimate assumes everything goes perfectly
**Solution**: Always add 15-25% buffer

### Mistake 3: Underestimating Revisions
**Problem**: "One round of revisions" takes 5 iterations
**Solution**: Define revisions clearly, specify number of rounds, charge for extras

### Mistake 4: Not Clarifying Scope
**Problem**: Client assumes much more is included
**Solution**: Be explicit about what's IN scope and OUT of scope

### Mistake 5: Forgetting Integration Complexity
**Problem**: "Just connect to their API" - API is undocumented mess
**Solution**: Ask for API docs upfront, add buffer for integration work

### Mistake 6: Optimistic Time Estimates
**Problem**: Assuming you'll work 8 productive hours per day
**Solution**: Use 5-6 productive hours per day for estimates

### Mistake 7: Not Pricing for Risk
**Problem**: Fixed price with lots of unknowns
**Solution**: Use hourly for discovery, fixed price after scope is clear

### Mistake 8: Saying Yes to Everything
**Problem**: Client keeps adding "small things"
**Solution**: Have a clear change process, charge for scope changes
