## Example Persona Building Prompt

```
I've uploaded customer feedback from different sources—sales call notes,
support conversations, survey responses, and interview transcripts.

Analyze this data to figure out what types of customers we have based on
their actual behavior and problems (not demographics).

Create an interactive artifact where I can explore each persona and see
their journey. Show their goals, what frustrates them, and include actual
quotes from customers.

Make the artifact professionally and elegantly designed, as it will be
shared with executives. Focus on creating analytical and helpful content.

Use Extended Thinking to analyze thoroughly, identify patterns across all
sources, and validate your work.
```

## Follow-Up Analysis

After creating personas, continue with:

### Written Report for Distribution
```
Create a written report from your analysis that I can share with our
executive team. Include the behavioral segments you found, what each
segment needs, journey friction points, and specific recommendations
for our product roadmap.
```

### Revenue Opportunity Identification
```
Which segment represents the biggest revenue opportunity if we optimized
the product experience for them? Walk through what we'd need to change.
```

### Quick Wins from Support Data
```
For the largest segment, pull the most common support ticket themes and
show me which product changes would eliminate the top three issues.
```
